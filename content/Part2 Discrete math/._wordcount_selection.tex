           $\gcd(r_1,b)$.Then by repeated applications of the Euclidean division algorithm, we have

            $a=bx_1+r_1$, $0<r_1<|b|$ $b=r_1x_2+r_2$, $0<r_2<r_1$

            $r_{n-1}=r_nx_{n+1}+r_{n+1},\quad0<r_{n+1}<r_n$
            $r_n=r_{n+1}x_{n+2}$,

            where the $r_{n+1}$ is the last nonzero remainder in the division process. Now, as illustrated in the example above, we can use the second to last equation to solve for $r_{n+1}$ as a combination of $r_n$ and $r_{n-1}$. Unfolding this, we can solve for $r_n$ as a combination of $r_{n-1}$ and $r_{n-2}$ etc. until we eventually write $r_{n+1}$ as alinear
            combination of $a$ and $b$. S
