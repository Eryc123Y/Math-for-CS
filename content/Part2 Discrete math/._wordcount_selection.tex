        \[ a = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \ldots p_n^{a_n}, \quad b = p_1^{b_1} p_2^{b_2} \ldots p_n^{b_n}, \]
        where \(a_i\) and \(b_i\) are the exponents of the prime factors of \(a\) and \(b\), respectively.

        The product \(ab\) can be expressed as a prime factorization:
        \[ ab = p_1^{a_1+b_1} p_2^{a_2+b_2} \ldots p_n^{a_n+b_n}. \]

        From this, we can deduce that any common multiple of \(a\) and \(b\) must be a product of their prime factors raised to at least the maximum exponent found in either \(a\) or \(b\). Therefore, the \(\text{lcm}(a, b)\) can be expressed as
        \[ \text{lcm}(a, b) = p_1^{\max(a_1,b_1)} p_2^{\max(a_2,b_2)} \ldots p_n^{\max(a_n,b_n)}. \]
        This ensures that \(\text{lcm}(a, b)\) i
