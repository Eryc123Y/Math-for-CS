\chapter{Graph Theory}
\begin{remark}
    This chapter involves the knowledge of combinatorics, which is in chapter \ref{counting}.
    You may read through that chapter from basic counting method to random variables.
    If you have learned what have been discussed so far, those content will not cause
    too many troubles. Do at least read through \textbf{Permutation and Combination}
    before dive into this chapter.
