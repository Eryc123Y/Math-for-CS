In this part, we discuss wider topics on probability and probability distributions. 
Probability theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the analysis of random phenomena. The fundamental concept of the theory is the probability measure, a way of assigning a number to each plausible outcome of an event in such a way that the number reflects the event's likelihood of occurring. This mathematical framework allows for the study and modeling of uncertainty and complexity in various fields, ranging from physics and biology to economics and psychology. By providing the tools to make quantitative predictions about the likelihood of certain outcomes, probability theory forms the basis for statistical inference, enabling scientists and statisticians to infer properties about a population given a sample. The origins of probability theory can be traced back to the analysis of games of chance and has since evolved into a vital component of both theoretical and applied mathematics.
\chapter{Counting and Probability Axioms}

The very first chapter in this part focuses on the basics of counting, which is the foundation of the whole probability theory. In the study of probability, people aims to measure random events, and to do this, we must know their frequency, or rather, how many possible outcomes each event has. Counting method allows us to get the possible number of outcomes in a systematic way.
